# CampZone

CampZone is an app where users can login and explore various campgrounds at different places. They can also share their campgrounds and comment on others.

## Salient Features:

1)App contains all information regarding a campground along with its location representation on the map.<br>
2)Users can login, view already present campgrounds and add their own campgrounds also.<br>
3)A user can comment on already added campground but cannot make changes to its data. Hence, it provides authentication as well as authorisation.<br>
4)All the data is managed using MongoDB database.<br>

## Technologies Used:
CSS, Bootstrap, EJS, JavaScript, Node.Js, Express, MongoDB<br>
Additional Tools Used: MapBox, Cloudinary<br>
<br>

I have deployed it using Heroku.<br>
